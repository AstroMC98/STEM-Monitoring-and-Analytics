We see the jobs with the highest growth rates (CAGR) from 2017 to 2021 plotted against the 2021 log-scaled job count representing the number of available jobs in the market. We see some high-growth STEM jobs with a relatively low volume of job postings (e.g., Robotics Engineer) which may indicate the infancy of the role in the Philippines. Some have relatively low growth rates but already with a significant number of job postings, indicating that these have stable demand (e.g., Software Developers).
