OJVs for the same or similar positions can take on many different titles due to internal company terminology, industry jargon, or even personal writing preferences of the recruiter. The dataset of over 56,000 job postings had over the same number of unique job titles. Job Title Normalization entails mapping every job posting to a finite number of positions to make it possible to analyze data across the same positions and aggregate it within job families. Furthermore, normalizing titles will allow us to leverage big data on the internet,  thus potentially making LMI automated and agile.

An occupation represents a specific position that can be uniquely called by alternate titles but has similar responsibilities. In this research, every unique job posting title is matched to the closest Alternate Title, which subsequently rolls up to an Occupation. By doing so, we managed to focus our analysis on 814 unique occupations from all the job postings. Furthermore, employing normalization in the market eases talent mobility, allowing employers and applicants a more consistent understanding and alignment of expectations.
