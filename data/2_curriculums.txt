We plotted the curriculums based on the normalized number of skills we extracted from the curriculum description we used in our data set and the percentage of those skills found in the online job postings. We can observe how most of the engineering and math courses have a high number of extracted skills which can be attributed to the level of detailedness of the documents available for those. In addition, we also see these courses with a high percentage of skills found in online job postings, indicating that the courses supposedly teach skills that has demand in the Philippine job market.
